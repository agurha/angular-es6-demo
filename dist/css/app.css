LESS variables are information about icon's compiled state, stored under its original file name

.icon-home {
  width: @icon-home-width;
}

The large array-like variables contain all information about a single icon
@icon-home: x y offset_x offset_y width height total_width total_height image_path name;

At the bottom of this section, we provide information about the spritesheet itself
@spritesheet: width height image @spritesheet-sprites;

The provided classes are intended to be used with the array-like variables

/*
The `.sprites` mixin generates identical output to the CSS template
  but can be overridden inside of LESS

This must be run when you have at least 2 sprites.
  If run with a single sprite, then there will be reference errors.

Original Bootstrap's CSS depends on empty href attributes to style cursors for several components (pagination, tabs etc.). But in AngularJS adding
empty href attributes to link tags will cause unwanted route changes. This is why we need to remove empty href attributes from directive templates and
as a result styling is not applied correctly. The remedy is simple, just add the following styling to your application. http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/
