# AngularJS ES6 Demo
Demo project using ES6 in Angular. Gulp as the build tool.
The ES6 is transpiled using [browserify](http://browserify.org/) with the [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) plugin and then minified using [uglify2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2). 

Unit testing examples uses karma with jasmine

This sample code was based on/inspired by [Exploring ES6 Classes In AngularJS 1.x](http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/350/exploring-es6-classes-in-angularjs-1-x?utm_content=buffer184f8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer)

Run **npm install** to install/update all dependencies

Requires gulp to be installed globally with **npm install -g gulp**

To build just run **gulp**  
Other gulp tasks 
* *watch* - will watch for any changes in the less or js files and will auto rebuild if required
* *css*   - will only build the css
* *js*    - will only build the javascript files (transpile ES6 code with browserify (babelify plugin) and then minify and generating source maps)
